**Scrabble** **Project** **Speciﬁcation**

Build the logic for a simpliﬁed version of Scrabble. The logic is tested via included tests, which should not be changed.

**Scrabble** **Rules**

Scrabble is played on a square grid, 15 spaces to a side. Each turn, the
player will place a set of letter tiles on the board to form a new word.
The tiles may be placed on the board, and the resulting words scored,
based on the following rules:

> If a play is not valid for any reason, the score for that play is
> zero, and the letters are not left on the board.
>
> Plays that result in invalid words are invalid.
>
> The validity of a word should be determined by the existence of the
> word in the words.txt ﬁle included with the sample projects.
>
> If you're not using one of the built-in dictionary helpers, then you
> may use your own, but you *must* use the words from words.txt. Matches
> should be case insensitive (the built-in helpers convert every word to
> lowercase).
>
> The ﬁrst move of the game *must* include a tile on the space 7,7 (the
> center space).
>
> Subsequent moves must form words by sharing at least existing tile.
> You may not replace existing tiles.
>
> You may share existing tiles by placing new tiles at the beginning or
> end of an existing word. If more than one tile is placed, they must
> all exist within a single horizontal or vertical line.
>
> The score for a move is the sum of the point values for each the
> letters making up *all* of the newly formed words. Note that a play
> can form many words by being placed against several existing tiles.
> For example, in this play
>
> the player formed the word "NOT," but also formed the words "NO" and
> "OW." **All** **these** **words** **must** **be** **valid** for the
> moved to be valid, and the player gains points for the total value of
> all the words.

**Ignored** **Rules**

If you're familiar with Scrabble, you know that those aren't all the
rules. However, the rules above, and as implemented in the included
tests, are all the rules that you need to implement for this project.

**Letter** **Values**

The value of each tile is as follows, based on the tile's letter:

> A: 1
>
> B: 3
>
> C: 3
>
> D: 2
>
> E: 1
>
> F: 4
>
> G: 2
>
> H: 4
>
> I: 1
>
> J: 8
>
> K: 5
>
> L: 1
>
> M: 3
>
> N: 1
>
> O: 1
>
> P: 3
>
> Q: 10
>
> R: 1
>
> S: 1
>
> T: 1
>
> U: 1
>
> V: 4
>
> W: 4
>
> X: 8
>
> Y: 4
>
> Z: 10

**Game** **API**

Your API must conform to the following rough rules; changes for the sake
of language conventions (e.g. functional languages might not have
classes/instances, capitalization may be different, etc.) are ﬁne.

> You must be able to instantiate multiple separate games (e.g. no
> globals, etc.)
>
> There must be a method or function playTiles that accepts an
> array/list of dictionaries/hashes
>
> Each hash contains a letter, row, and col key indicating the tile's
> letter value and position on the board. row and col should be 0
> through 14.
>
> The return value of playTiles should be a dictionary/hash with the
> keys valid and score, indicating whether or not the move was valid,
> and how many points it scored. Invalid moves are worth zero points.
>
> There must be a way to access the current running score via a
> function/method/property named score.
